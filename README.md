Just learning how to do the git-hub thing


About TCadd:
Approaching middle age and decided it was time to get back to my creative roots as a coder. 

About the 'Project':
I have an awesome idea for an app I can make a bit of money from in order to fund the time I need to create a more comprehensive version for teacher use in classes to allow students to increase their understanding of subjects via simple quizzes in various formats using a single database of questions per subject or pulling from multiple databases per teacher designation.

Design Challenges:
Primarily the back-end design and implementation is where I forsee the major issues; I'm not well-versed in database design, queries or even the basic systems used. I also want it to be possible to be modular, able to be editted easily and store the information consistently, and on a per-user basis keep scores logged (including which questions were used, and which answers selected by the user to allow for reviewing of gaps in knowledge.

Front end design is expected to be simple, in keeping with the focus on the information rather than the cool buttons and effects. 

Shareable question banks should be a core design concern, as well as allowing automatic updating of question banks via wifi.

In the game version it should be possible to make question banks purchasable ($.99 each?) as that is the only way I want to monetize the game, but also have an 'annual(?)' pass option that allows adding unlimited databases for the player - potentially for $4.99?

No adds!

Question banks built by people knowledgeable in subjects, possibly with each question rated on a rough difficulty scale, and with links included in every question to point to online resources for more information related to the question. Picture questions made possible by implementing links to image resources online as well, which can be optionally pre-downloaded at the same time (or later) as the question bank in order to save mobile data.

Thats enough for now, more to follow as time goes on.
